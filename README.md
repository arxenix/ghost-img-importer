# Ghost Image Importer
Make all images in your ghost blog self-hosted!

It's not good practice to rely on other sites to keep your blog's images hosted. If you have been doing this (like I have), you can use this script to migrate all images to being self-hosted.

What this script does:
1. Go through all of your blog's posts and find any external image links
2. Uploads the images to your own blog
3. Updates the image links to point to the uploaded ones
